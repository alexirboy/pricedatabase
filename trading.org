#+TITLE: Trading

so what is it that needs to happen then.
so i need to do is place a trade at  point where the current move ends. So this means that the current move will actually end.
- current move will end :: therefore you only go against the current TTF move direction
- will need to place trades in direction of the HTF move to benefit from reversal breakout moves. :: meaning only placing trades when the TTF move is in the same direction as the HTF move, you only really want to place a new trade on at that point when the HTF move gets to a point where the HTF move can be reversed from
- you do do not have to be able to get the whole move perfectly :: meaning that you just need to be able to enter at a place where the move on the chart will be reversed from in some form and you need to exit whilst the price is still past your entry point on a favourable direction.
- a reversal breakout will not occur without the HTF move also making a new one :: meaning that you are safe to place trades at a reversal point as long as the HTF move is not going to reverse direction

all the game is incomplete info and benefiting from it.
you do not need to make a perfect collection of a move. You can exit whenever and still make money as long as you are in a favourable position from your entry.
This means that you can basically exit if you are in profit because that is fine. you are in profit. you need to always enter for a reason and that is your reward. You need to always know that your knowledge is always going to be imperfect meaning you need to make money in spite of not knowing the answer and that would always be the case.
wanting to know everything before hand will just not work and not wanting to place a trade until you figure out what the next move is will just not be the case at all. You need to not know for sure but still make money consistently. That only happens by following certain stuff that happens to price most times and playing of that.
You need to be ok with not knowing but risking anyway and you need to be able to think properly and clearly about what your possible options are and being able to calculate the risk vs reward as accurately as possible. Know that 1 trade simply cannot take you out of the game at all.

* always going to be the case - This is the game that is being played
- Trades will be either losses or wins
- I will never know exactly what price will do and what the outcome of a trade will be
- current move will stop and reverse at some point
- current move will be 1 of the 4 different types of moves
- current HTF move reversal will play out in one of the culmination of ways on the TTF

So these things are here for me to know what type of game it is that I am playing. If I am feeling a type of way about any of this stuff being the case then that means I am trying to play a different game. These are the fixed variables, the rules so to speak, of this game.
Get to be ok with them because that is the environment you are playing in.

Another thing that I need to come to grips with if I need to be ok with the environment and the set of rules and circumstances that I am playing in is that I will not be able to get to a position where every trade is worth thousands in the time it takes to snap my fingers. All of this takes time for me to complete, especially if I am not able to be feeling ok with doing basic stuff.

** Quick side note.
you *expect* a certain *feeling* when *results* happen. When those *results* do happen and the *feelings* you have are not what you *expected* then you, effectively, think that you have not done what you have set out to do because if you had done what you had set out to do then you would have felt differently about it. The proper way to go about that scenario I think is this. When you do get results and you do not get the feelings that you expected to get then you should re-adjust you're expectation's of what feelings should be expected. Never think that you have not attained the results because you have not attained the expected feelings. On the contrary you have attained the results you have just not attained the feelings you thought you would have, therefore you change what you're expectations of the feelings are so that they match reality.
At least that's the expectation. When this cycle is repeated over and over then this can end up with the belief that you can never do stuff properly and you just can't do stuff and attempting will only bring failure, along with any negative consequences that may come with that. Focus on attempts at doing stuff not the actual results itself.

So just a thought as well. You think that the future feeling of a good result will be good feelings.
You also think that the future result of a bad feeling will be a bad result.

Hence when you get a good result and the good feeling doesn't come you are left wanting because you expected a different feeling as a indicator to when you have gotten that good result. The result almost isn't really what you wanted, what you were looking for, it was the feeling.
Like wise, when you have a bad feeling, you use this as a indicator to almost be a proof that the current action, or results that will ensue, are bad. Again the inner feeling dictates how you perceive actions and results externally.

I think this is starting to be more and more the bad focal point in your sights. Maybe you should not be looking for feelings as a sign. Maybe the sign should be the attempts made.
Maybe more attempts, more time spent actually trying to DO, to try and progress towards a thing is what should be the sign that indicates if stuff is going well or not.

Ye maybe the feeling is not a dictation of a future result and neither is it a confirmation of a task successfully completed. Maybe with me my feelings at the moments are a little messy, maybe I am a little sick in this regard. Perhaps I shouldn't listen to them too much at this time until I can get better from this. Perhaps listening to attempts is a better predictor of future results and a better sign of when achievements are coming to their completion.

I put this in the "always going to be the case" section because up until this point, the problems have been. Maybe I shall start to trust less, and look for less, my feelings and look upon attempts and trials more. I will attempt to at least ;)
* back to basics
All this is placing a bet or buying a certain amount of something at one price and then reselling it at another and vice versa.
So to do it well means to be able to buy or sell at a point and resell at another point where the price is in your favour and you have a profit. That is basically all the concern. A good way to go about a task is to know the requirements and be able to work backwards.

All this game really is dealing with is risk. The only way that you can get rewarded is if you are willing, and have, placed risk onto the market by having bought or sold something. That's it.
You are basically saying "*I am willing to bet 2 pips that price will not move to my stop loss by fulfilling this event and I think that it will move in the other direction for around 4 pips fulfilling the other event.*"
The second part of the risk equation that you are effectively playing in is this. "I am willing to bet that price will move up from this point than down, or vice versa, *because I think it is the more likely scenario to take place.*"

That's basically the game you are playing. You are dealing with the unknown on every trade in the sense that you never know with 100% percent what is going to happen. However you do have options and you can tell roughly what may be the likelihood of these options panning out and what would be the reward or risk that would be accrued if these scenarios happened.
The hope is when you can see and realise what the options are and what the cost to acting actually is, you will feel less inclined to feel bad about trading because you know that losing does not equate to a catastrophic loss if done right. Instead losing is most definitely part of the path to get the results that you want to get.
** Basic Requirements
*** be able to buy/sell at a place where price will not hit your stop loss before making a new move and exiting at a point whilst you position is still in profit.
one way this can happen with the constraints on the SL size is through entering at points where a new move will be formed or where a new move has ben formed and you enter in hopes of the move carrying on it's momentum.
Placing SL at a place the current move can reverse from.
*** be able to do this consistently enough to where your win percentage is at least 50% and preferably more.
This just means finding a method that is consistent enough to where it is reliable and happens more time than not in your favour.
*** aim for an average win size of just over 4 pips
Only enter the trade if the likely event that is aimed for can give at least this amount of movement in price from entry point if not more.
- This means that if you are entering into a trade that is against the current HTF move and you are expecting that a fib will ensue then, because you think a fib will be the case and you do not know what fib line the price will reverse from, that move that just happened on the TTF should ideally be at least 12 pips in size. This will allow the 31.8% line to have been around 4 pips from the new move starting price.
*** be able to benefit from larger moves which I am going to define as being larger than the average required move which is about 4.2 pips.
Entering in the direction of the HTF move in order to benefit from reversal breakouts on the TTF is one way of allowing this to be the case.
** what this does not mean
- These requirements does not mean that getting small moves under the average size will lead to me not being profitable overall
- does not mean that you have to never lose at all to be profitable overall
- does not mean that you need to get the entirety of a move's span to be profitable overall
- does not mean that you need to enter exactly where the move starts from to be profitable, because you only need to benefit from future price movement. As long as SL is not hit and price has moved to a profitable price point that's all that matters
- does not mean that you need to always aim for large moves. Aiming for what is possible is a lot better.
** Starting with a new plan
So I'm gonna jot down what I think will help me achieve the thing that is needed to get this stuff done.

- Every trade should be aimed for at least 4.2 pips. If the trade you want to make does not have that then you should not go for it.
- Trade with the HTF move direction because this gives you lee way into allowing you to hopefully have a larger pip value in winnings, due to the possibility of RB moves.
- Only trade against the HTF move direction at a place where it can be reversed from and when the events mean that it will likely start the reversal during the next TTF move or soon after. This means that if the TTF move is a reversal breakout, you only really want to trade against it when the next move has a possibility of being a reversal.
- If you think the HTF move will not reverse but the TTF will, then only take that trade if the 31% fib would be at least 4.2 pips away from the start of the new move? This means the move length would be around 12 pips in length. Also because you think the HTF move will not reverse then that means if the TTF move does reverse then that will give you at most a reversal and at least a fib move. So being conservative means that the closest target ideally should meet the minimum requirement, just to be safe.

So I think that trading in the direction of the HTF move will allow me to benefit from the most amount of price movements as this can allow me to benefit from reversal breakouts and reversals more often than not.
I also want to only trade against the HTF move direction, in general, only at a place and when the events are right for the HTF move to be reversed.
So I also only really want to enter a new trade at a place where the current move can end at and where the events are possibly aligned for it to do so.

There are a few things you can do for a trade then that if repeated should lead to wins in general and not losses.
1. with HTF move direction at a TTF F or R or a HTF point in between these in hopes for a continuation of the HTF move or at least a reversal of the TTF move
2. opposite to the current HTF move but at a place and with events that would reverse the current HTF move at that time and place. Or if the HTF move will not be reversed but the likely ensuing TTF move would be, at the closest target, at average pip goal or greater.
*** Things to think about
**** Reversals
- R after RB moves can happen when the R is starting at a SS/RR point that is 2 or 3 TF higher than it. For example, the 1m can reverse after a RB if that RB move ends at a 30m or 4h SS/RR area.
- R after RB moves can happen when the HTF move that the TTF move is on is at a HHTF SS/RR for the second attempt, at least of breaking through it. Basically it's on the second leg of the trend. This I think can at least cause a few reversals to happen, even after reversals.
- R after RB moves happen can happen when the TTF move is going in the opposite direction to the current HTF move and the TTF move has hit a point it can reverse from. The LTF move that is a RB can then lead to having a R or RB in the other direction, in line with the HTF move direction, from that point. Basically it needs less of a reason, double tops/bottoms, to reverse as it is already going against the grain of the HTF move.
- Not technically having to be a RB after a R but when there is a stall, on a TTF move for instance, and that looks like it may cause a change of move on that TF. What can end up happening is that there is a slight poke through that point, basically a false breakout, and then the move changes. What this looks like on the LTF however is most probably a RB followed by a R or RB. Just good to know.
**** Losing
If losing is done properly, there is nothing to worry about. Basically you can't lose. You worry about losing a trade because you think losing a trade can mean you will lose the whole account. Not if the strategy is followed properly.
you can have losses half of the time and as long as you follow protocol and win an average of 4.2 pips and lose on average about half that then you are actually absolutely fine. That means that you do not know what price will do exactly 100% of the time, but you will know generally that you are taking a riskier move or a less risky move.
*LOSING CANNOT HURT YOU. IT DOESN'T MATTER*
**** Context switching
So different scenarios, basically when your in a trade, out a trade and in the beginning of a trade. Need different contexts to switch to in your head. Need to see risk but in different ways.
**** Synonymous moves
So I haven't thought of this for some time actually but just thinking about these moves in terms of having a reversal after a breakout. They are the same as their TF up equivalents so a reversal here would certainly mean a new move on the HTF. Just a thought to try and remember what I was saying when moves like this were happening and what that would mean when trading.
**** When the HTF move is changing direction on its TF when the TTF is making a move
I think that this means that the TTF move, whilst it is still being in play, has the risk of turning into a synonymous move for the HTF. Therefore it may be a bigger move even if the previous move was a RB move.
*** Things to remember when getting in to a trade
- Where do I think the HTF/HHTF move is heading towards? What move will it likely be and where would it stop?
- If I place a trade at this place, what event will need to occur for me to get a 4.2 pip move and how likely is that to happen?
- I want to be going in the direction of the HTF move, am I if I go into this trade direction?
- What about the reversal structure? Do I think the LTF would more likely require a DT/DB reversal or not? Basically if I am more risky when I enter this trade by waiting for the LLTF to weaken only would that be a bad thing?
*** Things to remember when in a trade
-
* states of being in a trade
** not in a trade
so thinking of entering a trade. risk aversiveness, there is no money that is lost for missed oportunities in this state so conservativeness is good here. the only opportunity cost there is that you may miss out on the trade that would have actually been profitable but that is ok.
So I have the most amount of flexibility in this state with out any other constraints that are here with me. so that is the best place to try and consider factors. however you will never know for certain what will happen and you will also lose as a result your actions. Guessing makes money too, just educate guessing.
*** what loses in this state
- reversal is not that move :: figure out how price moves and act accordingly
- reversal is not at that place exactly, basically it is a overshoot from where you have put the stop loss. :: enter at as an extreme area of the price as you can, wait for LTF structure to build up a bit before entering,
** in a trade whilst winning
so when in a winning trade you are risking your current winning for potential wins by holding onto the trade. So that in effect is the trade off. Do I hold it and wait possibly for more wins or do I let it go now as this is as good as it gets for this move.
so this is pure risk vs reward. calculated statistically it is AMOUNT x LIKELIHOOD of risk vs reward. also what your goal is in this trade is also a part of it as well because you can wait and hold onto a move but that move can then reverse and turn into another move. then this trade is not longer trying to get a TTF move but probably a HTF move instead.
*** what loses in this state
- you lose your current winnings if price reverses from where it was at a previous point :: this doesn't necessarily mean you have a losing trade just a trade that was not as much as it could have been if it was exited at an earlier point
so in this state what is required is to calculate the risk vs the reward. That means in both the amount and likelihood in each of these things happening whilst in the context of a certain result. Most the time this certain result is 1 move on the TTF. The goal could also be to not have a loss or to just exit at the first signs of resistance
** in a trade whilst move hasn't moved a lot and is not winning
so when you first enter a trade and you are expecting it to be able to get into profit you are in a place where you have invested into a position and you are automatically on the losing side until you pretty much get into about 1.5pip nominal movement. The reason why this is a state is because the leverage is so high with the way that i trade and a 3 pip loss can equal over a 10% percent loss in total account size. I think the thing to do at this stage is to make sure that you are clear on why you are entering at this place. what move are you hoping to capture and if the LTF structure can help on anything here.
This is all tied in with the above of trying to calculate risk and reward but also it is seeing if the two points of failure of entering into a trade, wrong move and an overshot move, will play a factor in this current trade.
If you think they do then i think cutting your losses short is a great thing to do. yes you might have cut your losses short on a winner but that winner is only in hindsight when you know what already happened. Having less losses is better and a lot easier to recover from.
* reversal points
- undershot
- overshot
- just right on the spot
* risk
risk is both an event that may occur and a pip value that may be had both in loss and profit. A move may or may not happen, price may or may not overshoot. You are also risking a certain amount in stop loss which may allow you to make a certain amount in profit pip value wise.

*EVENT, MOVE, PLACE*
when placing a trade you need to be thinking about all these things. not only the place, aka which line you want to enter and think a new move will occur from. but also what move do you think will occur and what events in price movements will need to occur for this move to be the case.

these three things at least should be in your head when looking to get a trade. It should then be weighed up with the risk of a loss happening also.

** risk of loss
The risk of loss in the market in terms of pip value is always the pip value of your stop loss and also the likelihood of price hitting that stop loss. The events this is tied to is also a risk. So the risk of a certain move being the case instead of another move or the risk of the TTF not making a move that goes against the HTF at this point and just breaking through instead. All of these events are risks as well a the likelihood of each occurring.

So there are nominal risks and event driven risks that need to be calculated.
nominal risks are always the amount of stop loss value.
event driven risks are the events that may occur in order for the nominal risk to be realised
** risk of reward
* Starting a fresh
This bit is going to be me putting my goal of working into practise in the context of trading. What I want is to work, that is the goal. Having targeted results is basically a way of allowing me to work out on stuff in a targeted manner.

The gist to all of these rules and plans is basically trying to turn the infinite possibilities of the charts into a limited set of actions for me to do.

** Correct Goals
So first thing to think about is not anything technical it is actually starting with a proper goal. For the longest time I have made my goal for currency trading a result. This needs to stop because conflating the result as a goal does very bad stuff to my feelings. The first thing to do is start with changing the goal. The goal is to be working. I want to be targeting a certain result but I do not care if I get the result or not in relation to how good or bad I feel because the result does not take the place of the goal. The result is literally just a byproduct of work that I do and the work is the goal. This is the first thing that needs to happen, an actual shift in goals.

So practically speaking then what are the goals that I would like to implement in trading. Well the goal is to actually be thinking, not feeling, about what is price going to be doing and by what actions can I benefit from that movement. That is basically it.
*This is the goal. It is to think with a clear mind about what price will do next and why and how I am able to benefit from that and why.*
** HTF Move and HHTF Influence
- What is the HHTF move direction? What move do you think that will be? :: This will be used in anticipating if the default reversal structure two TF below can be the default or not.

- What is the current HTF move going to be? where will it stop at? That is the next thing along the process that needs to get done. Is this move going to be a R a RB or a F move? why? Where do you think it's going to stop? :: Remember you only really want to go in the direction of the HTF move direction and only go against it when it is likely to reverse or the TTF move is likely to reverse with a possibility of at least a 4.2 pip movement.
** 4.2 pips
You need your target to be a profitable trade of 4.2 pips. Know this and have this in mind whenever you are thinking of entering.
if you was to buy sell at market, or closest S/R, what event would need to happen for you to profit 4.2 pips? How likely is that event?
** Current TTF move and next trading opportunity
So now you have an idea of what the HTF move is probably going to be and where it is going to stop. What is the current TTF move saying? What type of move is that and where about is it going to stop do you think. You basically have two criteria up to this point that you need to trade by and those are:
1. Your trade should be going in the direction of the HTF move
2. you should be entering only when it is likely to have a 4.2 pip movement from your point of entry.

Knowing those are your criteria you basically wait till those criteria can be met and when it is likely to you take the trade.
This is the most fundamental version of a trading plan without getting into the technicalities of price movement.
- *The question on your head when thinking of entering a trade is "If I enter this trade at this point then what would it mean, event wise, for price to move 4.2 pips in my favour and how likely is that to happen" and "Is this trade going to be in line with the HTF move direction?"* :: If it is not in the direction of the current HTF move then is it possibly the start of a new HTF move? Basically being with the HTF move means that you are more likely to get a move in that direction and the only way you can profit from a RB move.
** Sensible Defaults
A way to think about defaults are that each thing is the default if it is in a isolated environment however the mixing of different factors mean the defaults either have a bigger reaction than normal, a expected F move becomes a R move because of another thing that is also happening. Or can also be a lesser of a reaction, expecting a RB but get a R instead due to the addition of another factor also. This is how you should use these defaults. You can also see it as certain scenario's are exceptions to the rules.
Here are a few sensible defaults that I think price generally just does "normally":
- A reversal of a move, on the TF below it, looks like a double top/bottom mostly. This means that waiting for a LTF double top/bottom is something that can be used to assess whether the TTF move may be changing and use that as a opportunity to enter. Entering on the the second leg once it is about to be rejected.
- After a RB move has happened and a pull back is occurring, the default move for that is going to be a a F move followed by at a least a reversal if not a RB.
- a new TTF move can occur in the opposite direction of the HTF move at a HTF S/R even though that HTF move will not itself end there. The opposite direction TTF move will not be a RB move unless there is a new move on the HTF also
*** Move Combo Default Next Move
**** Previous move was a F
- This move was a F also and next move is a RB
- This move was a R and next move is a R or RB
- This move was a RB and the next move is R or RB or F but the F move is opposite to the current HTF move direction
- This move was a HTF move before a R and the next move is a RB
**** previous move was a R
- This move was a F and the next move could be any type of move
- This move was a R and the next move is mainly R or RB with a small chance of a F move
- This move was a RB and the next move is RB or R or HTF move before R
- This move was a HTF move before a R and the next move is F
**** Previous move was a RB
- This move was a F and the next move is a R or RB
- This move was a R and the next move is a F or HTF F. Small chance of a RB when the HTF is looking like it will make a new move
- This move was a RB and the next move is a F
- This move was a HTF move before a R and the next move is a F or a HTF move before a R
** Nitty Gritty Technicalities for when defaults do not happen
So I have my defaults that are just normal and what I expect however that does not mean they are always the case. Therefore I need to know when they are not going to be the case and what is going to to be the case instead on that instance. This is where the nitty gritty technicalities come in. They deal with knowing when the defaults will not happen and what will happen instead. It is all about knowing cause and effects.
*** Reversals
- R after RB moves can happen when the R is starting at a SS/RR point that is 2 or 3 TF higher than it. For example, the 1m can reverse after a RB if that RB move ends at a 30m or 4h SS/RR area.
- R after RB moves can happen when the HTF move that the TTF move is on is at a HHTF SS/RR for the second attempt, at least of breaking through it. Basically it's on the second leg of the trend. This I think can at least cause a few reversals to happen, even after reversals.
- R after RB moves happen can happen when the TTF move is going in the opposite direction to the current HTF move and the TTF move has hit a point it can reverse from. The LTF move that is a RB can then lead to having a R or RB in the other direction, in line with the HTF move direction, from that point. Basically it needs less of a reason, double tops/bottoms, to reverse as it is already going against the grain of the HTF move.
- Not technically having to be a RB after a R but when there is a stall, on a TTF move for instance, and that looks like it may cause a change of move on that TF. What can end up happening is that there is a slight poke through that point, basically a false breakout, and then the move changes. What this looks like on the LTF however is most probably a RB followed by a R or RB. Just good to know.
*** Risk/Reward when in a trade
So when you are in a trade you are weighing up the risk/reward ratio however the R/R ratio is tied to the current TTF move being stopped or carrying on. You however are also having the bigger picture HTF move in your head for the most part as a way for you to be able to know whether you are ok doing a certain move or not, because the HTF move is the the one that dictates to you the direction and the "field" that you are playing in.
However even though the HTF move may be going at a point further past where the price currently is. This TTF move may not be and may reverse from this price point before reverfsing again and continuing in the direction of the HTF move.
As you know, a TF move can be stopped by a S/R of its own TF or a TF above it in general. Therefore you need to weigh up the risk of this move stopping where it is also. And for that to be part of the R/R ratio means thatt you amust probably have less time to think as well as have the LTF to give you clues as well.

All this would need very good knowledge of how price move even unto thinking about it very quickliy so that even teh 10s charts would be a helpful way to have clues on stuff. I think that you need to figure out as much as you can what the things you need in order to get really good at the nitty gritty technical details of stuff is.
A lot of this stuff also hinges on when you think reversals happen at.
*** Role of a stop loss
** Things to remember
The risk reward ratio can be summarised as. I am willing to bet this much, in pips, that price will move at least 4.2 pips in the other direction thanks to this move wich is more likely than another move in the other direction.
*** When getting into a trade
Assessing to see wether you should get in
I have time pressure as can miss opportunity or best price if taken to quickly or to late
Can enter and just be totally wroing in what I am thinking which would mean a loss

- The whole question that you are trying to answer and profit from is "If I enter this trade at this point then what would it mean, event wise, for price to move 4.2 pips in my favour and how likely is that to happen". If the answer above is that the event is very likely then you take the trade. That is all you are trying to ascertain. How likely is the event in which price would move at least 4.2 pips in your favour going to be.
- You only really want to be trading in the direction of the HTF. If you take the trade you are thinking are you going in the direction of or against the direction of the HTF move?
- you can wait for a reversal structure on the LTF before entering for a move change. However remember its relation to the HHTF move, might mean that a RB on the LTF may be followed by a R or a RB instead of a F that would form a reversal structure.
- Remember missing a trade you do not lose money. You can be slow to enter and quick to leave if you want and that is not a bad strategy.
*** When in a trade
- When in a trade, there are only two options. Exit or stay. The reason for exiting is because you think you cannot get any more profit and are hence trying to not incur any more loss or loss of profit or the risk/reward ratio is not worth it to stay in.
- The fact that you are in a trade does not change how price moves. So do not change the way that you feel or think when in a trade. Price moves the same regardless
- A trade is tied to a move on teh TTF. You are trying to get a new move on the TTF that gives you atleast 4.2 pips and milk it for anything more it gives you on top of that. That move on the TTF is a trend on the LTF therefore it will have extensions and pullbacks and reversal structures when reversing. Play of that.
**** Quick thoughts on when in a trade
When in a trade the main things that you are trying to do is to minimise losses and maximise profits. A trade is tied specifically to one TTF move therefore I think that because of these two things you would need to be thinking slightly differently when in a trade vs when out of a trade.
When getting into a trade you are basically trying to think when a certain criteria is going to be the case and then when you think that is so, you enter and then the next phase begins. This is when you are in the trade and the only two actions that you can do is hold it or let the trade go. Why would you do either?

Hold the trade solely because you think there is a good potential of further profit to be had. In other words you think that the currrent TTF move you are in will still be able to move in its current direction further. It also insinuates that you have looked at not only the price movement potential but also the likelyhood for this potential to take place. You have looked at the risk/reward ratio basically and have thought that it is worthwhile taking the risk of holding and suffering a loss in profit or loss overall for the chance of profiting from this potential movement that you think may be the case.

Letting go of the trade is done because you think that this move has reached its end or the risk/reward ratio has been weighed up and is not so favourable then you would rather take out the trade rather than risk what is already on the table for a lower potential of movement to be had

So from what I can see. When in a trade I am thinking about the risk/reward ratio of stuff and when that is not good for you any more, you exit. When that is good for you you stay and risk more.

So from this being the case I need to basically have the risk reward ratio weighed up in my head. So the risk side is how much of my position am Iwilling to risk losing, by holding the trade, in order to potentially gain the reward. The reward is calculated as the amount that can potentially be gained and the likelihood of that happening. So when in a positin that is the things that you are trying to calculate and play off of.
*** When wanting to exit a trade
Assessing to see wether you should get out.
has time pressure as can miss best price of exit and can even make a loss happen if not careful
If indecisive can loss capital
has stop loss that has to be thought about. Helpful tool to automatically take you out at places where you thought price shouldnt get to if what you thinking is right

- The question that you should be asking yourself when thinking of exiting a trade is "Where do I think that this move will end up going to, how many pips away is that? And what am I risking in order to see if that would be the case. Does that sound like a good tradeoff?"
*** For your head
- The only thing that stops you thinking properly and not trading well is the fear of losing and having unrecoverable regression in account size and a string of lossees that would turn out into a "catastrophe". Remember that can only happen if the method that you are doing is wrong and what you think about price movement is just not true. That means no matter what you do you cannot prevent the inevitable from happening. However the reverse is also true. If what you think about how price moves and how to trade it is correct then there is nothing that can be done to stop the inevitable from happening, in this instance it is good.
- Do not expect anything fantastic or a great feeling  when trading well or the ability to have a whole bunch of money in one trade very quickly. It does not work like that. It is consistency that wins the game not critical moves.
- You are the type of person that is able to make a whole bunch of money with trading and be able to trade well. It is you. You have always had a vague picture of someone external to yourself that you would need to be like to trade currency well and do well in this game and even though you have done good so far, you still think you cannot. Remind yourself what you have accomplished so far. You have put in the work and have had results to boot. You are the person that knows how price moves to a ok extent to make money from it
- See the importance of things righly. One trade will not make you. One trade will not break you. So do not make it a big thing in your head to the point where you get anxious over the result of a trade. Focus instead on price and where you think it is going. If you think it is going a certain direction that will see you lose then take the loss and go again. But one trade does not matter in the grand scheme of things. You need abouth a thousand trades to get to a substantial amount and that is about a months work so one is not substantial. Do not feel it as so.
- You do not need to be perfect and have perfect results. There is no point of feeling a type of way for nott getting the exact top to bottom of the move, especially even when looking in hindsight at it. Your job is not to have it perfeectly. Your job is to assess when it is in your favour to have a good trade of at least 4.2 pips and then take it and exit when you do not think that the move will carry on much longer or the risk is greater than the reward of it doing so. That is all
