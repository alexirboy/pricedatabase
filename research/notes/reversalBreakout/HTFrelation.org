- so quick note. looking at price on the chart, one thing to look at is the HHTF relation to stuff maybe. Basically what major lines for the HTF and TTF were broken that the RB went past? and what conditions did that happen in?

- when there is a RB followed by an RB move. Did the HTF move it is in also break through do a RB also or was it a R?

- just a thought. For a RB move that follows a RB move. I am sure that it has something to do with The HTF move and its structure on that TF as well as What line the RB move stopped at.

- Where does a RB move stop at? What normally happens at that point? HTF move only? a combination of both or never solely one HTF S/R?

- When a move overshoots. Is it trying to reach a S/R level a little bit further on before returning back? is that a common theme?

- when a RB moves happen. What line does it go through? HTF or TTF only. And how do you know how it sort of plays out on the LTF? one massive swing or a few? why?

- When a RB move occurs on the HTF and then a F or R occurs after, will the TTF reversal structure from that F or R be a one swing more likely or a DB/DT? Will that price scenario have any affect on the way price behaves basically?

- Just a thought, because there are different reversal formations like DT and HDT and QDT. Fib moves can folliow fib moves and reversals can follow reversals and fibs.

- It is safer to trade a move after the RB move has happened because there are generally only 2 possible moves that can happen.

- When a RB is followed by an RB move, is it because on the HTF the previous move was a RB move and the current move is the R or F that follows it and the move after will be in the direction of the HHTF move?

- A new possible category on the database - is the move currently within a HTF SS/RR area? it hasnt broken out yet of the HTF point no?

- When is a move more messy or giving itself more chances to get through to a lower low or higher high? or pushing through barriers it could stop at?
  I think when the HTF move is allowed to do that. If the previous HTF move was a reversal and this HTF move could be a RB, then the TTF moves do not have to stop at HTF SS/RR that would not stop the HTF move. Hence why moves are allowed multiple swings on the LTF before going in the opposite direction. Becasue there is less reason on the HTF why it should do so. Basically potential must count towards something
