- so quick note. looking at price on the chart, one thing to look at is the HHTF relation to stuff maybe. Basically what major lines for the HTF and TTF were broken that the RB went past? and what conditions did that happen in?

- when there is a RB followed by an RB move. Did the HTF move it is in also break through do a RB also or was it a R?
