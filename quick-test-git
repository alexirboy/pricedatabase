So this is a test to see what I can do with this thing.

I want to see that it is easy for me to edit stuff and go back to tthe way that
it was before. I want to be able to destroy my pro
gram and get it back whenever I want bnecause i can. Not to worry about doing bad changes becasue I know Ican sort it

so a quick test to see whether I can get back the change the way it was before?
test number two. I am now making a nother chage in the middle of the file and seeing if I can do anything about
editig particualr cde in the lines only. not just the while file

So apparently staging means that its a index before the snapshot so I am not surethe point of it at all. lets see I guess.
another little thing I am doing. you can stag hunks which if a am not mistaken is little pieces of code!!

what about when i have not saved the actual file yet? Turns out you cant!

Sooo I have learnt quite a bit of stuff about all of this stuff and it is kl
