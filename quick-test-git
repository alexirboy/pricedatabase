So this is a test to see what I can do with this thing.

I want to see that it is easy for me to edit stuff and go back to tthe way that
it was before. I want to be able to destroy my pro
gram and get it back whenever I want bnecause i can. Not to worry about doing bad changes becasue I know Ican sort it

so a quick test to see whether I can get back the change the way it was before?
test number two. I have staged the first chenge and I want to see wether I can get teh stuff working proper

So apparently staging means that its a index before the snapshot so I am not surethe point of it at all. lets see I guess.
another little thing I am doing. you can stag hunks which if a am not mistaken is little pieces of code!!
