So this is a test to see what I can do with this thing.

I want to see that it is easy for me to edit stuff and go back to tthe way that
it was before. I want to be able to destroy my pro
gram and get it back whenever I want bnecause i can. Not to worry about doing bad changes becasue I know Ican sort it

so a quick test to see whether I can get back the change the way it was before?
test number two. I am now making a nother chage in the middle of the file and seeing if I can do anything about
editig particualr cde in the lines only. not just the while file

So apparently staging means that its a index before the snapshot so I am not surethe point of it at all. lets see I guess.
another little thing I am doing. you can stag hunks which if a am not mistaken is little pieces of code!!

what about when i have not saved the actual file yet? Turns out you cant!

<<<<<<< HEAD
did a little edit and it so happened to go on the other brachj form here
fair enoug this is kl though this version control stuff. I am doing stuff I couldlnt have imageinda and am very happy wiyth that,
one thing that I am notucug though is that withh git it is basically a way to have snapshots
inside folders or branches. then each of these filders have a diffferent version og the files thatn what uou want and also these files
themselves have different versions of themselves on there too. Thats pretty good as well,
How though do I become able to replace the latest save file of one branch with a previous commit of the file on the same branch?
ahve that one a recent. Also How do I have a commit in another branch become the recent commit in the master bracnh or something like that?
Basically able to be revertig as easily as I would liek?
=======
Sooo I have learnt quite a bit of stuff about all of this stuff and it is kl
