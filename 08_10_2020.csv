Move TF,Time of move,HTF move this move is in,Direction in relation to HTF move,Previous move on this TF,Line the previous move started from,Did it overshoot or undershoot,What is this move,What line Did it start from,Did it overshoot or undershoot,How did the beginning of this move reverse from the LTF perspective,Any notes
HHTF,04:00,F61%,WM,R,HTF SS,no,RB,HTF SS,yes - slighlty overshot,HDB,this move was in the asian session and carried on into the london session so take the stats witha grain of salt
HTF,11:00,RB,WM,R/HHTF F38%,RR at HTF RR at HHHTF RR,no/yes - it slightly overshot the HTF RR furthest line and the HTF and HHHTF closest lines,RB,SS at HHTF F38%,yes - overshot the HTF SS by a bit as well as the HTF F by a little too,DB,the move was ultimately a 4hr move and the closest daily RR line was touched on this HTF move. So because the HTF move was breaking new grounds on the TF above it; the regression would be then that this move did not have to stop except at a point that stops the move on the highest TF that was not breaking ground or was OM to. However that is the logical conclusion but does that happen?
TTF,11:06,RB,WM,R,F38%,no,RB,SS at HTF SS at HHTF F38%,no,DB - the second down leg made a RB move,this move was a big one and didnt really have much stoping it except a few RR points and the massive daily RR area the price was in currently. It also had a few HHTF amd HTF reistance areas it was heading to however it got stopped at its own RR area. It stalled for a bit at one TTF area prior but the second area stopped it.
TTF,11:20,RB,OM,RB,SS,no,RR within HHHHTF RR area,no - it was right in the middle of the tight RR area,DT - there were multiple swings in the LTF,This move almost looked like two moves on the TTF. It reversed slightly to the up side on the LTF in what was a HTF RR move from the LTF context. That looked like a mini R in the TTF. The previous TTF move and the current HTF were synonymous so the F points were the same. The LTF move made a new move at the LTF RR a bit before the 38% F but then gave way into it.
TTF,11:26,RB,WM,RB,SS,no,R,HTF F38%/F38%,no,HDB - basically had two swings R on the LTF. Second swing was almost down to the first but just kindas missed it,the move had a little mini R as it got to a possible weak RR on the same move as the RR it stopped at. only made a LTF movement though before continuing towards end move
TTF,11:30,RB,OM,R,HTF F38%/F38%,no,R,RR,no,HDT - first swing was a R then a F before a reversal breakthrough,the only reason I can think of that this move didnt go any higher is becauseof the RR but also because it was in the region of the dasily RR also
TTF,11:34,RB,WM,R,RR,no,R,SS,no,DB - multiple swings,stopped at the closest line on the RR
HTF,11:40,RB,OM,RB,HTF SS/HHTF F38%,yes - overshot the HTF SS by a bit as well as the HTF F by a little too,F61%,RR within HHHHTF RR area. Possibly also be HHTF RR if considered as undershooting it,no/yes - depending in what line you consider it being stopped by. The TTF line was what was most accurate but the HHTF RR could be seen as being undershot and stopping it,DT - multiple swings,this move seemingly began from a buildup of RR moves that then just caused the previous HTF move to end. It does not look like there were any more reistance lines on any other TF that would have had an effect on ending the previous move apart from the HHHHTF one on the daily chart. This move stalled a little at the F38% level making a few swings on the TTF. That coincided with a SS point as well.
TTF,11:39,F61%,WM-FM,R,SS,no,DB - multiple swings,RB,RR,no,HDT - R move followed by F then RB,The HTF move at the point this move was being made looked unable to continue very much more as there were a quite a few wicks to the upside. This could have had an effect also? This TTF move also stalled a little on its way down as it got to SS levels. They only made moves onthe LTF however.
TTF,11:48,F61%,OM,RB,RR,no,F38%,HTF F38%/RR,no,HDT - R move followed by F then RB,
TTF,11:51,F61%,WM,F38%,HTF F38%/RR,no,R,F38%,no,DT,
TTF,11:54,F61%,OM,R,F38%,no,R,SS at HTF F38%,no,DB - multiple swings,the LTF had 3 swings to reverse this move whilst prior it was inly two for the move before.
TTF,11:56,F61%,WM,R,SS at HTF F38%,no,RB,RR at HTF F23%,no,HDT - first move was a R followed by F then RB,the LTF moves was quick on this one. each swings happened within 1 to 2 candles in each move. Move stalled slightly on the HTF F50% level on its way down making a LTF move.
HTF,12:00,RB,WM,F61%,RR within HHHHTF RR area. Possibly also be HHTF RR if considered as undershooting it,no/yes - depending in what line you consider it being stopped by. The TTF line was what was most accurate but the HHTF RR could be seen as being undershot and stopping it,F61%,F61% at HTF F38%,no/yes - it slightly overshot the HTF F by a little bit but the HHTF F it was pretty much spot on,HDB - multiple swings but basically R then F with a few R in each move,might have expected a R or a bigger move as this was in the direction of the HHTF move and the HHTF move had not yet reached its RR on its TF.
TTF,12:03,F61%,WM-FM,RB,RR,no,R,HHTF F38%/HTF F61%,no/yes - it slightly overshot the HTF F by a little bit but the HHTF F it was pretty much spot on,DB,move stalled quite a bit just under the HTF F50% line. Went on to break past it though without making any mini TTF move. Carried onto RR point.
TTF,12:12,F61%,OM - must have looked like it was a new HTF move at one point however as the HTF candle this move was in shows a lower wick,R,HHTF F38%/HTF F61%,no/yes - it slightly overshot the HTF F by a little bit but the HHTF F it was pretty much spot on,HTF F50%/F50% - the previous move was a new move on the HTF so the F points are the same for this move,RR,no - perfectly touched the furthest RR line,DT - multiple swings just touching LTF RR line,
TTF,12:15,F61%,WM,HTF F50%/F50% - the previous move was a new move on the HTF so the F points are the same for this move,RR,no - perfectly touched the furthest RR line,R,HTF F50%/F50%,no,OS - R,this move could have been seen as the second up leg to a double top that reversed the HTF move at the HTF F50% level.
TTF,12:16,F61%,OM,R,HTF F50%/F50%,no,R,HTF F50%/RR,no/yes - overshot the HTF F50% level but was within the RR boundaries fine,QDT - F followed by F then RB,
TTF,12:19,F61%,WM,R,HTF F50%/RR,no/yes - overshot the HTF F50% level but was within the RR boundaries fine,HTF F61%/R,SS,no,OS - RB,this move reversed using the LTF RR very precisely. this move was a sort of mix between a R and a RB/HTF F
TTF,12:23,F61%,OM,HTF F61%/R,SS,no,F50%,HTF F61%/TTF resisatnce,no/yes - did not really overshoot or undershoot by a lot but it overshot the RR and undershot the HTF F61%,DT,
TTF,12:25,F61%,WM,F50%,HTF F61%/TTF resisatnce,no/yes - did not really overshoot or undershoot by a lot but it overshot the RR and undershot the HTF F61%,R/HTF F61%,F61% at HTF F23%,no,OS - RB,the moves were creaping up to touching the HTF61% line and this literally just touched it before stopping
HHTF,11:00,WM-FM,RB,HTF SS,yes - slightly overshot,RB,HHHHTF RR,yes - overshot the HHHHTF RR closest line,QDT,This move began from a weird place. It didnt even get to a 4hr RR or its own TF RR level. It stopped basically at a RR line due to a build up in RR moves at that line. This move was also basically a daily move and only needed to reverse at any point the daily move would reverse at; which it was in due to being at a daily resitance area. Therefore I think that was why it could have reversed at any point within that area basically?
HTF,12:25,RB,WM-FM,F61% within HHHTF RR,F61% at HTF F38%,no/yes - it slightly overshot the HTF F by a little bit but the HHTF F it was pretty much spot on,RB,F61%,no,DT - multiple swings,this move probably was not expected at all because the HHTF move was not hit even though this was also a HHTF move it was in. This move reversed the HHTF move so that was just not expected. The move didnt have any trouble getting past the the previous HTF move or any HTF move for that matter. It only started stalling when it got to the HHHTF F points. The HHHTF F points caused mini moves on this HTF move but didnt reverse it until it got to the 50% F point. The HHHTF F points also coincided with HHTF SS levels also.
TTF,12:26,RB,WM-FM,R/HTF F61%,F61% at HTF F23%,no,RB,RR at HTF F61%,no,HDT,what a move! it broke through everything in its way. made a mini move on the HHTF F61% line but that didnt reverse the move. started having trouble when it got to the HHHTF F38% line. It then started to struggle to go down any more and for a few minutes it was quite choppy. That F line was also the furthest line on a distant HTF SS. The move didnt stop however until it got to a distant SS that was a few pips beyond the HHHTF F38% line. There were mini moves on at the HHHTF F line however.
TTF,12:47,RB,OM,RB,HTF F61%/RR,no,R - of mini move,HDT,SS/HHHTF F38%,no/yes - it overshot the HHHTF F38% by a little but the SS it was in the area,OS - RB,it took a lot to stop the previous TTF move and this move did not even reach the TTF F; any of them. it was surprising how when it was having trouble at the actual HHHTF F line; the move didnt stop therer but carried on and made this move at the SS.
TTF,12:49,RB,WM,R - of mini move,SS/HHHTF F38%,no/yes - it overshot the HHHTF F38% by a little but the SS it was in the area,R,TTF mini move RR,yes - slightly overshot the mini move RR point,QDT,the move was a reversal but a massive overshooting one. reached quite a few pips lower than the furthest SS line to reach the HHTF SS line but then quickly reversed in order to still make a wick respecting the SS.
TTF,12:54,RB,OM,R,TTF mini move RR,yes - slightly overshot the mini move RR point,R,HHTF SS/HHHTF F38%/SS,no/yes - overshot the HHHTF F and the SS but did not overshoot the HHTF SS,OS - RB,interesting to see the HHTF SS hit even though there was a little difficulty on getting past just the HHHTF F line
TTF,12:55,RB,WM,R,HHTF SS/HHHTF F38%/SS,no/yes - overshot the HHHTF F and the SS but did not overshoot the HHTF SS,R,HTF F23%/RR,no,DT - multiple swings,was a mini move when the move got to the F38% but then it carried on
TTF,13:01,RB,OM,R,HTF F23%/RR,no,R/HTF F23%,SS/HHTF SS,no,OS - RB,
TTF,13:03,RB,WM,R/HTF F23%,SS/HHTF SS,no,F61%,HTF F23%/RR,no,DT - the second leg of the double top was higher than the first,
TTF,13:06,RB,OM,F61%,HTF F23%/RR,no,F61%,F61% within HTF SS(mini move),no/yes - slightly overshot F61%,OS - slow swing to TTF F,this probably was due to how how a TF SS the price was facing. Thats why there it is at least more one sided in the last few moves
TTF,13:09,RB,WM,F61%,F61% within HTF SS(mini move),RB,F61%,no,OS - RB,
TTF,13:10,RB,OM,RB,F61%,no,F50%,SS at HTF SS(mini move),no,OS,this move could also be viewed as a mini TTF move but later in a few moves this move was used as a RR point hence the decision
TTF,13:12,RB,WM,F50%,SS at HTF SS(mini move),no,RB,F50%,no,DT - slow swing and very small swings as well,this move was the continuation of the HHTF and HTF moves. it broke through everything in its path and only stopped at the next HHHTF F point; the 50%. Stalled slightly at the furthest recent SS line but only made a move on the LTF. more precisely the stop of this move was at the HHHTF F50% within a HHTF SS area and at the closest HTF SS line within the previous two lines.
HTF,13:15,RB,OM,RB,HTF SS,yes - slightly overshot,TTF R,HTF SS/HHTF SS/HHHTF F50%,no/yes - overshot the HHTF SS closest line by a bit but overall was not overshooting the HTF by very much,OS - R,this was a weird almost mini move on the HTF but it can still be considered a move. The move is basically a TTF R move.
TTF,13:17,TTF R,WM-FM,RB,F50%,no,R,HTF SS/HHTF SS/HHHTF F50%,no/yes - overshot the HHTF SS closest line by a bit but overall was not overshooting the HTF by very much,HDB - first leg was a R followed by F,was a fast move. Stalled a little bit at a point that could have been considered a TTF F but eventually broke through to stop at the TTF mini move it started from. A bit of a weird move when looked at from the HTF as well
HTF,13:20,RB,WM,TTF R,HTF SS/HHTF SS/HHHTF F50%,no/yes - overshot the HHTF SS closest line by a bit but overall was not overshooting the HTF by very much,R,RR,no,OS,this move was just a F retracement on the TTF to the 50% level. it however looked like a enw move on the HTF though. This and the previous HTF moves were both synonimous with one swing on the TTF.
TTF,13:24,R,WM,RB,F50%,no,F50%,RR at HTF F23% at HHTF F23%,no/yes - overshot the HTF F23% line,no,OS - basically one swing. It was a slow turnover of move on the LTF,the move went quickly to the TTF/HTF F point and after that formed a mini range on the LTF chart for a few mins. Sort of looked liked a mini move on this TF.
HTF,13:25,RB,OM,R,RR,no,R,SS at HTF SS,no,OS - was one swing but has a long swing,did not really stop at a place that you would expect. could say that it stopped because of a HHTF F23% maybe but it is more likely to say that it stopped at the RR instead
TTF,13:28,R,WM,F50%,RR at HTF F23% at HHTF F23%,no/yes - overshot the HTF F23% line,no,RB,F50% at HTF SS at HTF F50% - synonymous moves,no,HDB - multiple swings,this move sort of had a quick down leg and then had a mini move and then ranged on the LTF for a while before breaking through the TTF furthest RR point. this could have been a bigger point on the HTF move.
TTF,13:36,R,OM,RB,HTF F50%/F50% - the moves where the same so the Fs are the same,no,R,RR,no,RB - OS,this was a weird sort of move because it could have been a bigger new move on the HTF in my view but it didnt.
TTF,13:40,R,WM,R,RR,no,R,SS at HTF F38%,no,R - OS,on the TTF this move lookede like a standard reversal but on the HTF move it is just a weird combo of moves
HTF,13:40,RB,WM,R,SS at HTF SS,no,RB,RR at HHTF F23%,no/yes - it did not overshoot the RR but it did overshoot the HHTF F,DT,straight move to the next HHHTF F61%
TTF,13:44,RB,WM-FM,R,SS at HTF F38%,no,RB,RR at HHTF F23%,no/yes - did not overshoot RR but overshot HHTF F23%,DT,the beginning of the move was started of with one big swing which reversed quite a lot and the second swing didnt reach as high on the LTF but on the TTF it just touched the closest RR line
TTF,13:47,RB,OM,RB,RR,no,F61%,SS at HTF SS at HHTF SS at HHHTF F50%,no,DB,move was basically at the lowest point the HHTF move had gotten to thus far and reversed at the furthest line of RR it could
TTF,13:51,RB,WM,F61%,SS at HTF SS at HHTF SS at HHHTF F50%,no,RB,F61% at HTF F61% - synonymous moves,no,HDT,move start was quite a quick R to try get into the LTF moves. This move stalled at a HTF SS below the R point and especially when it got to the SS within that HTF SS area. This did not reverse the move however. once it did get past the stall point it quickly got to the place it would reverse from
HTF,13:55,RB,OM,RB,RR/HHTF F23%,no/yes - it did not overshoot the RR but it did overshoot the HHTF F,F61%,HHHTF F61%,no,HDB,was not looking like a very confident move to be honest. Looked liek ot could reverse at any point for the most part when I looj at it in the entirety
TTF,13:59,F61%,WM-FM,RB,F61%,no,R,HHHTF F61%,no,QDB - LTF F followed by another F then breakout R,was a quick move and a big move. was just a reversal but was big
TTF,14:02,F61%,OM,R,HHHTF F61%,no,HTF F38%/F38% - HTF and TTF move were the same prior so F points are too,RR,yes - slightly overshot,DT - slow OS basicaly,
TTF,14:05,F61%,WM,HTF F38%/F38% - HTF and TTF move were the same prior so F points are too,RR,yes - slightly overshot,F38%,F38% at HTF F38% - synonymous moves,yes - slightly overshot,OS - F,
TTF,14:06,F61%,OM,F38%,F38% at HTF F38% - synonymous moves,yes - slightly overshot,RB,F38%,no,OS - RB,this move looked like it might be a new move on the HTF chart as it made a lower wick on a HTF candle. got stopped at the HTF F50%
TTF,14:08,F61%,WM,RB,F38%,no,RB,F50% at HTF F50% - synonymous moves,yes - overshot the F50% by quite a bit,OS - RB,was looking like it might be a R move because it stalled at the R point; closest TTF resisatnce line for a while. it however broke through after stalling for around 4 minutes or so at that point. the LTF bsaically broke through its little range in one big move then quickly reversed into a RB the move after.
TTF,14:16,F61%,OM,RB,HTF F50%,yes - overshot the F50% by quite a bit,F61%,RR,RR/HTF F61%,yes - slightly overshot the closest RR line and the HTF F61% line,OS - RB,
TTF,14:18,F61%,WM,F61%,RR,RR/HTF F61%,yes - slightly overshot the closest RR line and the HTF F61% line,R,F61%,no,OS - slow start RB,this was a quick move. basically just a swing on the LTF
TTF,14:20,F61%,OM,R,F61%,no,R,RR at HTF F61%,no,OS - R,again this move was basically just one move on the LTF. The last two TTF and LTF moves have been synonymous
TTF,14:21,F61%,WM,R,RR at HTF F61%,no,RB,SS at HTF F38%,no,OS - RB,this move is also one move on the LTF. the last three moves have been synonymous on the LTF and TTF
HTF,14:20,RB,WM,F,F61%,HHHTF F61%,no,F50%,HTF resisatnce/HTF F61%,yes - overshot the F line as well sa the HTF resisatnce,OS - RB,this move was basically a TTF move as they are the same. This move followed on from the shakey F61% move.
TTF,14:24,F50%,WM-FM,RB,SS at HTF F38%,no,RB,RR at HTF RR at HTF F61%,no/yes - did not over or undershoot anything except the HTF F61%,QDT,this move was slightly unexpected I think
HTF,14:30,RB,OM,F50%,HTF resisatnce/HTF F61%,yes - overshot the F line as well sa the HTF resisatnce,R,F50% at HTF SS at HHTF F50%,no/yes - slighlty undershot F50%,OS - R,the TTF move and this move were synonymous with eachother
TTF,14:30,R,WM-FM,RB,HTF RR/RR/HTF F61%,no/yes - did not over or undershoot anything except the HTF F61%,HTF R,HTF F50%,yes - slightly undershot,OS - RB,the move stalled a little on the TTF F points but broke through eventually
TTF,14:36,R,OM,HTF R,HTF F50%,yes - slightly undershot,F61%/HTF SS,HTF RR,yes - overshot the closest HTF ressitance line,OS - RB,stalled for quite a bit at the TTF F points however broke through them very quickly and made a false breakout,it broke through to just reach the HTF SS line
TTF,14:40,R,WM,F61%/HTF SS,HTF RR,yes - overshot the closest HTF ressitance line,F61%,F61% at HTF F38% within HTF SS,no/yes - overshot the TTF F61%,OS - R,was basically a LTF mvoe on the TTF chart
HTF,14:35,RB,WM,R,F50% at HTF SS at HHTF F50%,no/yes - slighlty undershot F50%,RB/R,RR at HTF F23%,no/yes - overshot the HHTF F23%,HDT,
TTF,14:41,RB/R,WM-FM,F61%,F61% at HTF F38% within HTF SS,no/yes - overshot the TTF F61%,RB,F61% at HTF RR,no,HDT,had a little bit of trouble getting past teh previoius SS level so stalled a bit there
TTF,14:45,RB/R,OM,RB,F61%,no,F50%,HTF SS/SS,no,DT,this move ended at a SS line within the HTF SS area
TTF,14:47,RB/R,WM,F50%,HTF SS/SS,no,R,F50%,no,DT,
TTF,14:49,RB/R,OM,R,F50%,no,R,SS at HTF SS,no,OS RB,this is a short little range this move is in. a bit of back and forth from the previous move
TTF,14:52,RB/R,WM,R,SS at HTF SS,no,RB,RR at HTF F38%,no/yes - slightly overshot the RR,DT,as soon as the move hit the HTF SS line the LTF did a little mini move
HHTF,13:30,RB,WM-FM,RB,HHHHTF RR,yes - overshot the HHHHTF RR closest line,HHHTF R,HHHTF F61%,no,DB,this move took long enough to end the london session so price moves a bit weird after this. It looked likd it could ahve been a F move but the mini move on the F61% line then got broken through. The move did not reach the HHHTF closest RR line though and undershot it by quite a bit. It did so at the point the London session shut though so it might have been that.
HTF,14:55,HHTF R,WM-FM,RB/R,RR at HTF F23%,no/yes - overshot the HHTF F23%,RB,SS at HTF SS,no,OS - had a little mini move on the TTF but it was basically a RB move,This move confrims the second leg of a double bottom. This was basically affected bt the HHTF F61% I think
TTF,14:55,RB,WM-FM,RB,RR at HTF F38%,no/yes - slightly overshot the RR,RB,HTF SS,no,HDB,this move was basically synonymous with the HTF move but it did have little mini moves inside of it. first was at the F61% level and the second was at an overshoot of the HTF resisatnce level.
TTF,15:16,RB,OM,RB,HTF SS,no,HTF F38%/F38%,HHTF F38%/HTF RR/RR,no/yes - overshot the HHTF F line and one of the HTF resitance lines but not the TTF rsesitance lines,QDB,
TTF,15:19,RB,WM,HTF F38%/F38%,HHTF F38%/HTF RR/RR,no/yes - overshot the HHTF F line and one of the HTF resitance lines but not the TTF rsesitance lines,R,HTF F38%/F38%,no,OS - RB,one of the swings on the LTF looked like it could have reversed the TTF move but it dod not and it carried on until just undershooting the clsoest TTF line
TTF,15:22,RB,OM,R,HTF F38%/F38%,no,F61%,TTF resisatnce,yes - slightly undershot the closest line,OS - R,this si basically a R move on the LTF being played out on the TTF chart
TTF,15:24,RB,WM,F61%,TTF resisatnce,yes - slightly undershot the closest line,R,F61%,no,OS - reversal,
HTF,15:15,HHTF R,OM - looked like it may have been a new move on teh HHTF chart as the HTF candle had a wick under it,RB,HTF SS,no,R,HHTF F38%/HTF RR,yes - overshot both the HHTF F and HTF RR furthest line,DT,the move started by breaking pst slightly the two previously mentioned lines but stopped quite precisely when it got to the RRl ine of teh HTF mini move that was slightly after both the aformentioned lines. This move was the start of a mini move on the HHTF also.
TTF,15:25,R,WM-FM,F61%,no,RB,RR within area of HTF RR,no,QDT,this move stalled slightly as it got to a TTF mini move that was past the R point for this move. It agaon stalled when it got to the mini move lower down as well but then suddenly broke through a little lower. The stall also coincided with the closest HHTF SS line as well
TTF,15:38,R,OM,F61%,no,RB,RR within area of HTF RR,no,F38%,HTF SS/HHTF SS,yes - overshot the closest HTF SS line,OS - RB,quite a fast move that was straight to the point without much warning of it starting
TTF,15:39,R,WM,F38%,HTF SS/HHTF SS,yes - overshot the closest HTF SS line,F61%,F38%,no,OS,quick move again
HTF,15:35,HHHTF R,WM,R,HHTF F38%/HTF RR,yes - overshot both the HHTF F and HTF RR furthest line,F61%,HTF SS within HHTF SS,no,QDB,
TTF,15:42,F61%,WM-FM,F61%,F38%,no,RB,F61%,no,OS - RB,stalled at each point in the HTF F line but only stopped and reversed at the 61% level
TTF,15:50,F61%,OM,RB,F61%,no,HTF F38%/F50%,HTF F61%,no,OS - breakout R,the move stalled so nicely on the 38% HTF F line but then it simply just broke through it and ddint even touch the HTF F50% line before reversing backand amking a new move. very sneeky. Also there was a mini TTF move at the HTF F38% as well.

TTF,16:04,RB,WM,RB,F61%,yes - overshot,R,SS within HTF SS within HHTF SS,no,OS - R,the swing of the previous two TTF moves have been synonymous with the LTF moves. This move also slightly broke past the R furthest line and touched the next RR line but it was quick enough to reverse and respect the R line
TTF,16:07,RB,OM,R,SS within HTF SS within HHTF SS,no,F50%,RR within HTF RR,yes - slightly overshot,OS - R,this move has a slowing momentum into the F line. This move slighlty broke past the R point abd touched the next TTF resisatnce
TTF,16:08,RB,WM,F50%,RR,yes - slightly overshot,R,F50%,no,DT - multiple swings,this move started slow with a mini range on the LTF.
TTF,16:12,RB,OM,R,F50%,no,R,RR,no,HDB,this move was a lmost sa minin move on the TTF but could also be considered a move also. Basically reversed straight back into where it started in 1 candle
TTF,16:14,RB,WM,R,RR,no,RB,SS at HTF F50%,no/yes - slighlty undershot the HTF F50%,DB,move that was basically a HTF move at this point. stalled when it got to the RR within the HHTF F38% and the HTF RR area. Made a minin move on the TTF also that got reversed form teh F38%. but move carried on going slighlty past that point to hit the next RR line. It hit the closest line and thats where it stopped.
TTF,16:21,RB,OM,RB,SS/HTF F50%,no/yes - slighlty undershot the HTF F50%,F50%,RR within HTF RR at HHTF F38%,no/yes - overshot the HHTF F38% by a bit and was in the middle of the HTF RR area but stopped perfectly at the TTF closest line,DT,move made a min move when it touched the F38% and RRl ine of TTF mini move however that reversed again and quickly touched teh F50% line. Both moves were quite quick to reverse themselves again however
TTF,16:26,RB,WM,F50%,RR within HTF RR at HHTF F38%,no/yes - overshot the HHTF F38% by a bit and was in the middle of the HTF RR area but stopped perfectly at the TTF closest line,R,F50%,no,OS - RB,the start of the moves R was quite quick and the move ended by barely touching the closest R line
HTF,16:20,HHHTF R OM,RB,HTF SS within HHTF SS,no,R,RR at HTF F38%,no/yes - overshot the HHTF F38% by a bit and was in the middle of the HTF RR area,DT,
TTF,16:27,R,WM-FM,R,F50%,no,RB,RR within HTF RR,no,QDT,this move is the extension of teh double top on the TTF. It stalled slightly at the HTF F50% level for a few minutes before continuing down. broke through the first set of SS levels and stopped at the closest line SS within HTF SS.
TTF,16:34,R,OM,RB,RR,no,HTF R,SS within HTF SS,no,OS - R,this move could almost be considered as a new move on the HTF. It stopped at a weird place a bit before the HTF RR area so was not sure what type of move to call this or under what HTF move to put it in. It stalled for a little bit at the F50% line but then brok through to just miss the HTF RR line before reversing
TTF,16:40,R,WM,HTF R,SS within HTF SS,no,F61%,HTF F61% at HTF RR,yes - undershot HTF RR and overshot HTF F61%,OS - RB,move whent cleanly down to the F point
HTF,16:30,HHHTF R,WM,R,RR at HTF F38%,no/yes - overshot the HHTF F38% by a bit and was in the middle of the HTF RR area,RB,SS,no,HDB,was probably influened by the few touches at HTF SS the previous TTF moves had. So their was upward pressure I think
TTF,16:43,RB,WM-FM,F61%,HTF F61% at HTF RR,yes - undershot HTF RR and overshot HTF F61%,RB,F61% at HTF F61% - synonymous moves,yes - slightly overshot,OS - R,the move reversed quite quickly and started stalling all throughout the HTF RR area. made a mini move as well but dod not actually stop until it broke all the way past it. This was a HHTF move as well so it theoretically didnt haveto stop anywhere except where the HHTF move could stop at which is what happened. Also stalled slightly before stopping as it was just shy of the HHTF F61%
HTF,16:55,HHHTF R,OM,RB,HTF SS,no,F61%,HHTF F61%,yes - undershot slightly,OS - HTF F61%,
TTF,16:56,F61%,WM-FM,RB,F61%,yes - slightly overshot,HTF F61%,HHTF F61%,yes - slighlty undershot,DT,was a biggish move. just stopped the prior big move and made this was quite a contrast
TTF,17:03,F61%,OM,HTF F61%,HHTF F61%,yes - slighlty undershot,HTF F38%/F38% - they were the same F points,HTF F61%,yes - slightly,DB,this move began with a mini move on the TTF and it ended very quickly
TTF,17:06,F61%,WM,HTF F38%/F38% - they were the same F points,HTF F61%,yes - slightly,F50%,HTF F38%/F38%,yes - slightly undershot,OS - F,this was a tiny move on the TTF. The whole sequence of mvoes to come was a bit undecisive and weird. This move was basically a LTF move played out on the TTF
TTF,17:09,F61%,OM,F50%,HTF F38%/F38%,yes - slightly undershot,R,RR at HTF F38%,no/yes - slightly overshot RR,DB - small swings,
HTF,17:00,HHHTF R,WM,F61%,HHTF F61%,yes - undershot slightly,F50%,F61%,no,DB - multiple swings,this move was a very weak one because the swings that made it up where very back and forth and indecisive of move. This was almost jsut a mini move on the HTF
TTF,17:12,F50%,WM-FM,R,RR at HTF F38%,no/yes - slightly overshot RR,R/RB,SS at HTF SS,no,OS - R,the startbasically made a mini move on the TTF. A weird mopve to try and categorize as it oculd be considered a reversal berakout as it broke past the RR hit the HTF F then retraced back and respected the RR line
TTF,17:16,F50%,OM,R/RB,SS/HTF SS,no,R,HTF F50%/RR,no,DT - R followed by reversal before a breakout,this move started of indecisive again as it made a mini move basically from the get go. on its way down as well it was stalling throughout until a sudden quick push on the LTF got it too the SS
TTF,17:20,F50%,WM,R,HTF F50%/RR,no,R,SS at HTF F61% within HTF SS,no,OS - breakout R,stalled a little bit when it gotto the closest RR line and made a mini move quite sharply down but that then reversed to break through and do a false breakout of the extremes of the TTF line
HTF,17:25,HHHTF R,OM,F50%,F61%,no,RB,F50%,yes - slightly overshot,DT,
TTF,17:25,RB,WM-FM,R,SS at HTF F61% within HTF SS,no,RB,RR at HTF F50%,yes - overshot both,DT,move did not stall anywhere. stopped only when it hit the SS and just undershot the HTF SS
TTF,17:32,RB,OM,RB,HTF F50%,no,F50%,SS at HTF SS,no/yes - undershot slighlty the HTF SS closest line,OS - RB,
TTF,17:36,RB,WM,F50%,SS at HTF SS,no/yes - undershot slighlty the HTF SS closest line,RB,F50% at HTF F50% - synonymous moves,no,DT,move stalled slightly when hitting the xlosest HTF line of SS but carried on slightly till hitting the furthest TTF line of SS within the HTF SS area. This was also the 61% F on the HHTF.
HTF,17:40,HHHTF R,WM,RB,F50%,yes - slightly overshot,R/RB,SS at HHTF F61%,no,OS - R,this move almost looked like it could be a RB but it didnt go far enough.
TTF,17:41,R/RB,WM-FM,RB,F50% at HTF F50% - synonymous moves,no,RB,SS within HTF SS at HHTF F61%,no,OS - RB,move stalled quie a bit at the HTF F points starting from the 50%. This even made a mini move on the TTF. same thing at the 61% level also,did not have any trouble getting past the R point however and it broke through it seemingly unscathed. stopped however when it got to the next HTF RR line.
TTF,17:57,R/RB,OM,RB,SS within HTF SS area at HHTF F61%,no,F50%/HTF F50% - previous move on the TTF and HTF were the same so the F points were too,HTF RR,no,DT,this move began by becoming a weird combination of two moves for the HTF so it was interesting. made a mini move on the HTF
TTF,18:02,R/RB,WM,F50%/HTF F50% - previous move on the TTF and HTF were the same so the F points were too,HTF RR,no,HTF R,F50% at HTF F50% - synonymous moves,yes - slightly overshot,DB,this move didnt stop at any real point on the TTF and only stopped at a sort of point inside the HTF area or RR made by the previous TTF RB move. This is because the previous move on the TTF made a mini move on the HTF.
HTF,17:55,HHHTF R,OM,R/RB,HHTF F61%/HTF SS,no,F61%,RR at HTF F50%,no/yes - it overshot the HTF F50% and the first HTF RR area but not the second,DT,
TTF,18:06,F61%,WM-FM,HTF R,F50% at HTF F50% - synonymous moves,yes - slightly overshot,RB,RR within HTF RR at HHTF F50%,no,HDT,this move stalled slightly at teh TTF F points and at the HTF F50% as well. made a few mini moves at that F point too. It did break lower from those mini moves slightily to just undershoot the HTF F61% line.
HTF,18:20,HHHTF R,WM,F61%,RR at HTF F50%,no/yes - it overshot the HTF F50% and the first HTF RR area but not the second,RB,F61% at HTF F38%,yes - slightly undershot F61% slighlty overshot F38%,QDB,stalled slightly at its R point but then broke through and went past even the HTF F61% point. this move was a continutaion of the HTF move
TTF,18:24,RB,WM-FM,RB,HTF RR,no,HTF F61%,HTF F61%,yes - slightly undershot,HDB,stalled slightly at the F61% point but then continued to break past slightly the HTF F61% point before reversing again
TTF,18:33,RB,OM,HTF F61%,HTF F61%,yes - slightly undershot,F50%,RR at HTF RR,no,OS - R,this was just a quick LTF move that appeeared on the TTF chart
TTF,18:34,RB,WM,F50%,RR at HTF RR,no,RB,F38% at HTF F38% - synonymous moves,no,OS - RB,this move stalled for a while whilst at the HTF RR area at where the previous HTF move began at. mini moves where made but did not reverse the mvoe until it got to the HHHTF closest RR line. It broke through a HTF RR area and HHTF F line in the process. This move was a continuation of the HTF move and HHTF move and HHHTF move.
TTF,18:57,RB,OM,RB,F50%,no,HTF F23%,HHHTF resisatnce,no,DT - small swings,this was a very accurate start at almost exactly a HHHTF RR line. very surprising. It als orespected the HTF F23% even though it didnt make a mini move on the HTF.
