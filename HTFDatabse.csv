Move TF,Time of move,HTF move this move is in,Direction in relation to HTF move,Previous move on this TF,Line the previous move started from,Did it overshoot or undershoot,What is this move,What line Did it start from,Did it overshoot or undershoot,How did the beginning of this move reverse from the LTF perspective,Any notes
HTF,11:00,RB,WM,R/HHTF F38%,RR at HTF RR at HHHTF RR,no/yes - it slightly overshot the HTF RR furthest line and the HTF and HHHTF closest lines,RB,SS at HHTF F38%,yes - overshot the HTF SS by a bit as well as the HTF F by a little too,DB,the move was ultimately a 4hr move and the closest daily RR line was touched on this HTF move. So because the HTF move was breaking new grounds on the TF above it; the regression would be then that this move did not have to stop except at a point that stops the move on the highest TF that was not breaking ground or was OM to. However that is the logical conclusion but does that happen?
HTF,11:40,RB,OM,RB,HTF SS/HHTF F38%,yes - overshot the HTF SS by a bit as well as the HTF F by a little too,F61%,RR within HHHHTF RR area. Possibly also be HHTF RR if considered as undershooting it,no/yes - depending in what line you consider it being stopped by. The TTF line was what was most accurate but the HHTF RR could be seen as being undershot and stopping it,DT - multiple swings,this move seemingly began from a buildup of RR moves that then just caused the previous HTF move to end. It does not look like there were any more reistance lines on any other TF that would have had an effect on ending the previous move apart from the HHHHTF one on the daily chart. This move stalled a little at the F38% level making a few swings on the TTF. That coincided with a SS point as well.
HTF,12:00,RB,WM,F61%,RR within HHHHTF RR area. Possibly also be HHTF RR if considered as undershooting it,no/yes - depending in what line you consider it being stopped by. The TTF line was what was most accurate but the HHTF RR could be seen as being undershot and stopping it,F61%,F61% at HTF F38%,no/yes - it slightly overshot the HTF F by a little bit but the HHTF F it was pretty much spot on,HDB - multiple swings but basically R then F with a few R in each move,might have expected a R or a bigger move as this was in the direction of the HHTF move and the HHTF move had not yet reached its RR on its TF.
HTF,12:25,RB,WM-FM,F61%,F61% at HTF F38%,no/yes - it slightly overshot the HTF F by a little bit but the HHTF F it was pretty much spot on,RB,F61%,no,DT - multiple swings,this move probably was not expected at all because the HHTF move was not hit even though this was also a HHTF move it was in. This move reversed the HHTF move so that was just not expected. The move didnt have any trouble getting past the the previous HTF move or any HTF move for that matter. It only started stalling when it got to the HHHTF F points. The HHHTF F points caused mini moves on this HTF move but didnt reverse it until it got to the 50% F point. The HHHTF F points also coincided with HHTF SS levels also.
HTF,13:15,RB,OM,RB,HTF SS,yes - slightly overshot,TTF R,HTF SS at HHTF SS at HHHTF F50%,no/yes - overshot the HHTF SS closest line by a bit but overall was not overshooting the HTF by very much,OS - R,this was a weird almost mini move on the HTF but it can still be considered a move. The move is basically a TTF R move.
HTF,13:20,RB,WM,TTF R,HTF SS/HHTF SS/HHHTF F50%,no/yes - overshot the HHTF SS closest line by a bit but overall was not overshooting the HTF by very much,R,RR,no,OS,this move was just a F retracement on the TTF to the 50% level. it however looked like a enw move on the HTF though. This and the previous HTF moves were both synonimous with one swing on the TTF.
HTF,13:25,RB,OM,R,RR,no,R,SS at HTF SS,no,OS - was one swing but has a long swing,did not really stop at a place that you would expect. could say that it stopped because of a HHTF F23% maybe but it is more likely to say that it stopped at the RR instead
HTF,13:40,RB,WM,R,SS at HTF SS,no,RB,RR at HHTF F23%,no/yes - it did not overshoot the RR but it did overshoot the HHTF F,DT,straight move to the next HHHTF F61%
HTF,13:55,RB,OM,RB,RR/HHTF F23%,no/yes - it did not overshoot the RR but it did overshoot the HHTF F,F61%,HHHTF F61%,no,HDB,was not looking like a very confident move to be honest. Looked liek ot could reverse at any point for the most part when I looj at it in the entirety
HTF,14:20,RB,WM,F,F61%,HHHTF F61%,no,F50%,HTF resisatnce/HTF F61%,yes - overshot the F line as well sa the HTF resisatnce,OS - RB,this move was basically a TTF move as they are the same. This move followed on from the shakey F61% move.
HTF,14:30,RB,OM,F50%,HTF resisatnce/HTF F61%,yes - overshot the F line as well sa the HTF resisatnce,R,F50% at HTF SS at HHTF F50%,no/yes - slighlty undershot F50%,OS - R,the TTF move and this move were synonymous with eachother
HTF,14:35,RB,WM,R,F50% at HTF SS at HHTF F50%,no/yes - slighlty undershot F50%,RB/R,RR at HTF F23%,no/yes - overshot the HHTF F23%,HDT,
HTF,14:55,HHTF R,WM-FM,RB/R,RR at HTF F23%,no/yes - overshot the HHTF F23%,RB,SS at HTF SS,no,OS - RB,Move starting reversal had a little mini move on the TTF but it was basically a RB move on the LTF. This move confrims the second leg of a double bottom. This was basically affected bt the HHTF F61% I think
HTF,15:15,HHTF R,OM,RB,HTF SS,no,R,HTF RR at HHTF F38%,yes - overshot both the HHTF F and HTF RR furthest line,DT,the move started by breaking pst slightly the two previously mentioned lines but stopped quite precisely when it got to the RRl ine of teh HTF mini move that was slightly after both the aformentioned lines. This move was the start of a mini move on the HHTF also.
HTF,15:35,HHHTF R,WM,R,HHTF F38%/HTF RR,yes - overshot both the HHTF F and HTF RR furthest line,F61%,HTF SS within HHTF SS,no,QDB,
HTF,15:50,HHHTF R,OM,F61%,HTF SS within HHTF SS,no,R,F61%,no,DT,
HTF,16:00,HHHTF R,WM,R,F61%,no,RB,SS at HTF SS,no,HDT,
HTF,16:20,HHHTF R OM,RB,HTF SS within HHTF SS,no,R,RR at HTF F38%,no/yes - overshot the HHTF F38% by a bit and was in the middle of the HTF RR area,DT,
HTF,16:30,HHHTF R,WM,R,RR at HTF F38%,no/yes - overshot the HHTF F38% by a bit and was in the middle of the HTF RR area,RB,SS,no,HDB,was probably influened by the few touches at HTF SS the previous TTF moves had. So their was upward pressure I think
HTF,16:55,HHHTF R,OM,RB,HTF SS,no,F61%,HHTF F61%,yes - undershot slightly,OS - HTF F61%,
HTF,17:00,HHHTF R,WM,F61%,HHTF F61%,yes - undershot slightly,F50%,F61%,no,DB - multiple swings,this move was a very weak one because the swings that made it up where very back and forth and indecisive of move. This was almost jsut a mini move on the HTF
HTF,17:25,HHHTF R,OM,F50%,F61%,no,RB,F50%,yes - slightly overshot,DT,
HTF,17:40,HHHTF R,WM,RB,F50%,yes - slightly overshot,R/RB,SS at HHTF F61%,no,OS - R,this move almost looked like it could be a RB but it didnt go far enough.
HTF,17:55,HHHTF R,OM,R/RB,HHTF F61%/HTF SS,no,F61%,RR at HTF F50%,no/yes - it overshot the HTF F50% and the first HTF RR area but not the second,DT,
HTF,18:20,HHHTF R,WM,F61%,RR at HTF F50%,no/yes - it overshot the HTF F50% and the first HTF RR area but not the second,RB,F61% at HTF F38%,yes - slightly undershot F61% slighlty overshot F38%,QDB,stalled slightly at its R point but then broke through and went past even the HTF F61% point. this move was a continutaion of the HTF move
