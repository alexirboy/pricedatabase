HHTF,04:00,F61%,WM,R,HTF SS,no,RB,HTF SS,yes - slighlty overshot,HDB,this move was in the asian session and carried on into the london session so take the stats witha grain of salt
HHTF,11:00,WM-FM,RB,HTF SS,yes - slightly overshot,RB,HHHHTF RR,yes - overshot the HHHHTF RR closest line,QDT,This move began from a weird place. It didnt even get to a 4hr RR or its own TF RR level. It stopped basically at a RR line due to a build up in RR moves at that line. This move was also basically a daily move and only needed to reverse at any point the daily move would reverse at; which it was in due to being at a daily resitance area. Therefore I think that was why it could have reversed at any point within that area basically?
HHTF,13:30,RB,WM-FM,RB,HHHHTF RR,yes - overshot the HHHHTF RR closest line,HHHTF R,HHHTF F61%,no,DB,this move took long enough to end the london session so price moves a bit weird after this. It looked likd it could ahve been a F move but the mini move on the F61% line then got broken through. The move did not reach the HHHTF closest RR line though and undershot it by quite a bit. It did so at the point the London session shut though so it might have been that.
