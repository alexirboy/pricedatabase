move started at 15:00,reversal,at the beginng of the move the HHHTF was in a downwards move. This move was the first move of the new HHHTF move,a reversal ,the 30m support and 4hr 50% fib,it definately overshot the extreme of the HTF Resistance and it slightly overshot the 4hr fib but I would say that that it was a normal overshoot,breakthrough reversal,HTF support,no it reversed just after the closest extremity of the HHTF support. It also reversed from the HTF support within that region,the move reversed with one large reversal breakout on the HTF,,

15:00,breakthrough reversal,at the beginning of this move the HHTF move was a down move so the beginning of the up move would have been against the HHTF move. This was the first HTF move of a new HHTF move so it would always be going against it initially. It ended up being a move that was in the sme direction however,it was a reversal breakthrough ,it started from the HTF 50% fib point,"""not really, not exactly what id call a difficicult overshoot at all.""",a reversal breakthrough,both the HHTF and HTF support point,not really,one large breakthrough reversal,the HTF move had a resistance from the HHTF but it isnt plotted on the picture to the left. It was a large area of support and not hte most convincing. But could have prably played a part in stopping the move where it did as the move stopped in that region. Also the move visibly hada bit of difficulty getting to the highest resistance point on the HTF. This was due in part to the TTF having resistance at that point which stalled it for a bit. Also I think because it was in that HHTF area.,

15:07,a reversal breakthrough,this was the first move of a new HTF move so initially it was against the HTF move. However it then became the new HTF move so it was in the same direction eventually,reversal breakthrough,both a HTF 50% fib and a TTF resistance,nope for both,reversal breakthrough,"""from a HHTF, HTF and TTF support. Like it was quite exact and they aligned up quite well. The HHTF line looked as if it was a TTF line, like that exact.""",nope,no data but you can physically see there was at lest a double bottom on the LTF which is how th reversal played out.,this was a big move. There where little stalls along the way that looked like the move coud have reversed from. Firstly the fib points are two possibilitie. The yellow one looks like it should be the case more but the blue fib seems to stall the move more at the 50% line. Also the first TTF resistance stalled the move and made visible reversal on the the TTF but not a big enough one to make red candles. Only stopped the move at a higher up TTF resistance. It was also in the region of the HHTF resistance. Thats why I think it stopped even though it didnt stop at a HTF resistance even though it was basically a HTF move.,

On the lower time frame it probably looked like one large swing but not breaking trend. Therefore drawing a fib from that swing there could have been done but doing so didnt show any stall on this move. However drawing the fib from the next option down looks to reverse the price hence depending how you see it it could be a reversal breakthrough or a fib depending on how you read two ""moves"" prior",

It broke through all the HHTF resistance points and only stopped at the HHHTF rseistance point. That means that this was a continuation of a HHHTF or the 4hr move in that direction. This was intereseting that it didnt stop at all at any 30m resistance. I guess it doesnt have to but ye. It did stall visiibly however at certain HHTF resistance areas. The once that where past the reversal move point and into the HHHTF move region only however. Maybe thats something. It didnt however reverse anymove though.

18:01,23% fib,opposite direction,reversal / HTF 23% fib,TTF resistance,it did overshoot. It went in the middle of the two lines,50% fib,HTF 23% fib / TTF support,it overshot the TTF support but not the Htf fib,it had a small double bottom wherer the swing in between the two down legs was very small,,

18:00,breakthrough reversal,with direction,23% fib,HHHTF resistance (furthest line),it did overshoot a bit bt the line that stopped it was 2 TF higher so was not expecting an exact stop,reversal,23% fib,nope,it had a douible bottom of sorts. A bit of a more complex move as there were a few reversals in both directions before the move got decided,this move only structure it had really was the HHHTF resistance and the previous HTF upswing as resistance before there was a void. Also this was part of a double top that reversed the HHTF move,

18:04,reversal,was against the HTF move at first but then became the HTFmove so was woth direction ultimately,reversal,50% fib,lsightly undershot the TTF resisatnce pont,reversal,TTF support,slightly undershot,no 1 swing,the move stalled at the closest TTF resisistance line within the HTF resistance area. It stalled to the point that it made a mini fib move on the TTF down to the 31% fib line up to that point. It then stalled a bit before carryong on and only stoppin at the furthest line at the HTF resistance.,

18:12,reversal,against direction,reversal,TTF support,slightly undershot,mini reversal,HTF resistance (furthest line),no,no it was 1 swing,this was barely a new move. Basically a pullback in the LTF but made an impact on the TTF,

18:15,reversal,opposite direction,reversal breakout,mini TTF support,yes overshoot the HTF and TTF lines,fib 61%,HTF resistance,overshot quite a lot,it had a half double top,"""the moves before this move on the chart were leaving me with a few options as to where you could draw the fib, wether it would be the HTF or the TTF fib. I drew both, yellow is HTF, as you can see it adhered to the TTF fib more. The move stalled slightly at the 31% fib level also. This move also created a bottom wick on the HTF candle meaning that it could have been percieved as a new move.""",

18:20,reversal,with direction,fib 61%,HTF resistance,overshot quite a lot,fib 61%,TTF 61%,no,yes it was a double bottom,this could ahve also been affected by the HTF resistance line at this point s the move before made a lower wick on the HTF candle so it could have been seen as a legitimate resistance area,

It stalled at the TTF 61% fib, yellow fib, it didnt stop therer though but had aniother stall at the closeset HTF support line and reversed it slightly to a TTF fib point at that point. The close TTF support line after the close HTF line also played a part in slightly reversing the move. """,
